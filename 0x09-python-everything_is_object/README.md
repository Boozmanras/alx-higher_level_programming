n-everything_is_object

## Project Overview

This project explores Python's object model, focusing on understanding how Python handles various types of objects and their identities. Tasks include examining the behavior of integers, strings, and lists, and understanding how different operations affect object identity and memory management.

## Tasks

### 23. Tuple or not?
- **File:** `23-answer.txt`
- **Description:** Verifies if a single value enclosed in parentheses with a trailing comma is a tuple.

### 24. Who I am?
- **File:** `24-answer.txt`
- **Description:** Evaluates if two single-value tuples refer to the same object.

### 25. Tuple or not
